                                                             What is an Injector?
Here, You can find out how you can use your scripts. On roblox there are these things called injectors. What are injectors you may ask? Injectors is something that can
attach to your game. This can be a multiple game injector or a single game injector. When it attaches to your game depending on what it should do E.G Roblox Killer. The 
name is pretty much a dead-giveaway, By reading the name it must mean that it will kill roblox. How you may ask? Well by something injecting onto your computer game the
injector has access to reading everything maybe the binary code of your games, Even literally knowing the files of your game as in when you run it! Now when you inject
this one program. It has special access to do it's needs meaning it may need your files in order to "kill" the program. Pretty much an injector is a program that does
special things to your game because of it injecting it. Yes! It's literally like injecting a needle into somebody but the needle goes to your game.


                                                            What do I need to hack?

In order to hack on roblox, You have to have an executor. An executor is almost the same thing as an injector but instead of it being a premade program. It is a lua-code
based program. Normally they are a square box with a few buttons. Save file, Import File, Clear, Inject Or Attach, Execute and depending you may have "Themes" There are
Many executors. The most expensive being called "Synapse X" You have to buy it for $20 but it is a really premium executor and the one where you can see "Themes" So the
Executor has a big box where you can insert Lua-Code, Lua-Code can be found on https://pastebin.com or https://controlc.com/ there are MANY other script websites for this
others are kidn of annoying cause the have something called linkevertise. Linkvertise is an ad based website where you have to complete something in order to get your 
scripts or anything. People use it for money because you get very little money each click the link gets. Alot of other websites have literal ads and force you to disable
your adblock so they can aslo make money. For some reason they can't get a job because they are poor somehow, Any Lua-Code can be pasted into an executor no matter if it
is your script or somebody elses. If it's somebody elses then people will call you a Skid that's why you should learn how to lua script, Lua isn't only for executors! You
can 100% make a popular game with lua since Roblox Studio is all lua scripting. This is all of the knowledge you should need for now everything else is self explanatory
